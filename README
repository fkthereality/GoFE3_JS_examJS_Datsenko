I need several PSD pages to be converted to HTML. This job will include HTML5, CSS3,  BEM, JQuery, Responsive web design.
<ol>
  <li>
IE8 + Cross-browser compatibility </li><li>
Pixel accuracy for Chrome latest</li><li>
Responsive web design, there are three layouts for different devices. "Mobile first".</li><li>
Connect non-standard fonts, the files themselves are in the fonts folder. Use GoogleFonts.</li><li>
Use the preprocessor.</li><li>
Apply BEM.</li><li>
No Bootstrap or Pure.</li><li>
Make the most of HTML5 and CSS3 compatibility, but within the framework of cross-browser compatibility.</li><li>
Apply graceful degradation approach.</li><li>
All files must be collected using grunt.</li><li>
JQuery-plugin for the slider.</li><li>
Use the Masonry or Isotope plug-in for the title of "Discover holiday activity ideas.".</li><li>

The pictures themselves need to be taken using an ajax request from the service to search for pictures.</li><li>

After the block "tiles" there is a search field. When entering text into the field and clicking the "Search partners" button, the site needs to send a request for receiving images from our service, and replace the images in the tile with new ones corresponding to our request. </li><li>
Use the template engine and re-initialize masonry. As the text for each picture, use the word field from the server response.</li><li>
When the first load the page in the tile should display random pictures.</li><li>
Retina support.</li>
